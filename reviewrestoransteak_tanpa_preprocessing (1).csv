Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,Nirmala Hidajati,5.0,"The best steak house that I ever eaten. I ordered rib eye with mushroom sauce and mash potato and green bean. Rib eye is welldone but still juicy and smooth. Mushroom sauce is so nice creamy but not heavy. The greenbean is seasoned good. The waitress is friendly and very helpfull. The place is cozy and nice for take lunch or dinner with family, coworkers, and friends."

Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,Arafah Khoirul,4.0,The place was quite comfy. They have spacious parking lot. Im not an expert in food so for me the taste was quite tasty. I ordered medium steak. It was a bit raw but still ok. I liked the mashed potato. They still have birhtday promo and thats good
Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,Wulan Dhesi,4.0,"Thought it's the best steak in town. Why? It has many menus you can choose with fair price. Starting from 45K rupiah to 200K. And it serves fresh meat with savoury taste. I came here several times. Buddy's tenderloin steak which made of Japanese meat is my favourite. The meat is soft, juicy, and no fat. It cost 99K. You can ask more sauces for free but only for 3times. Whereas, my husband ordered Australian prime sirloin. It's juicy, soft, but it has some fat. He said, mine was better. It cost 99K also. So, with their high quality meat and its fair price, I would recommend you to come here. Luckily, if you come here during on your birthday, you'll get an ice cream!"
Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,Rezha August,4.0,"the holycow sc goes excellent with the spinach rather than w/ the steak.black pepper sc no argue!love it!reasonable price,lovable wait staff.but to me using frying pan as the serving plate is a big No! A bit challenging to cut the steak while the knife kept colliding the tall body of the pan (serving plate). And kinda think the ambience can be improved in order to enjoy the steak more."

Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,Maximillion Levin Anggasaputra,1.0,"Compared to other holycow's places I had visited before, this place is a total disaster.

Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,Ade Krisnawati,3.0,Worse than others Holycow branch. Ask for medium rare but they serve welldone. The meat isnt juicy at all. Too bad
Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,D C,4.0,"Always liked dining at Holy Cow branches in Jakarta. I often made it a point to have an empty stomach because the steak is so filling! However, I don't know why it is so different, but the Semarang branch has smaller steak servings and they don't offer refillable drinks. Staff were nice and attentive though. Overall still the place to go to when craving steaks in Semarang."
Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,Gideon Setyabudi Salim,1.0,"The place is comfortable enough and we're impressed by the parking service. But, they should serve better food and beverage considering the high price they demand. We had high expectation when visiting this steak hotel but we're really disappointed. The food they served is not fresh, chicken is stinky/fishy like it has been stored for a long long time. Wagyu steak was more on the dry side (not juicy) and salty (look like they tried to preserve the meat for as long as possible). Beverage was ordinary, we could not taste the sarsaparilla at the first slurp. We wait for long time to enjoy all of our orders. We'll not coming back to this place."
Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,Febriane Trinanda,5.0,"If you are steaks freak, this is the right place for you. Various steaks choice also beverages, from the ""economic one to lux"". You definitely got what you pay for. Worth the price. The waitress really helpful by answering all questions and give proper answer when we ask for suggestions. Btw, they should have a private place for their staff to have a break rather than allowed them to sat down on the back door.. they are quite surprised when we park our car on their back parking lot."

Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,Raden Arief Nugroho,4.0,"Where to find a great steak restaurant in Semarang? This is one of the options. Mostly imported meat. However, compared to Jakarta's finest steak restaurants (even for Willie Brothers level), this place is still nowhere near. Price ranges from 90k-200k. Beverage is rather limited. There is a playground for your kids, but not well-maintained. Flies and mosquitos bother me a lot. Small musholla is available."
Steak Hotel by HOLYCOW! TKP Semarang,Cindy Tabita,5.0,"Good steak. I asked for a very welldone meat since I am pregnant, and they let me check the meat to make sure it was well done. When there was a pink hue inside, they offer to grill it again"

You can choose also between french fries or mash potato and choice of vegetables from broccoli, spinach, etc. The steak come as per what is ordered. I order rib eye which was taste great.
